# AI Machine Learning Engineer

## Education
- University of California San Diego
- B.S. in Cognitive Science in Machine Learning and Neural Computation 

## Projects 
# Fine-Tuning Neural Network for Sketch-Aware Object Segmentation
- Working under Computer Science Prof. James Tompkin, I developed a sketch-aware object segmentation pipeline to
improve flood fill accuracy in raster sketches
- Fine-tuned Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) on the OpenSketch dataset to segment sketch object
outlines while ignoring construction lines—using bounding box prompts, decoder-only training, and a custom BCE + Dice loss; improved performance from baseline (Pixel Accuracy: 8.85%, mIoU: 1.74%, F1:3.22%) to 95.46%, 78.60%, and 87.65%
